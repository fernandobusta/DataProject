#Â DATA MANAGER APP

This is not the app, rather a step by step of API connections to fetch data from google.

## google-place-api.py
This file won't work since it requires an API key.
To run this file, create your own API key from Google's dev website and change the function call on 'API_KEY' to match your own private key. Keep it secure!
